# Mortgage Insurance
A consumer bank with a range of products would like to cross-sell insurance to its consumer base (that is, cross-sell the personal protection insurance (PPI) product to those customers who have a secured or unsecured type of loan, but no PPI product as yet). Data is provided for their customer portfolio containing various fields about their product ownership, credit standing, outstanding amounts, and whether they already have an insurance product (called as PPI / personal protection insurance), if any, the type of PPI product they own.

- The bank would like to adopt analytics driven approach applied on this sample data for deciding:
	- Who should they target from the pool of customers that currently do not have a PPI, and
	- What type of PPI product they should be targeting them with..
